# Hooks and verification

The heart of the method: replace one original routine at a time with native
code, and let the framework prove — not assume — that the replacement is exact.

## What a hook is (and is not)

A hook is a **minimal boundary adapter, not a place where logic accumulates**.
A good hook only:

1. reads the relevant state from original memory/registers,
2. calls a clean native recovered function (which knows nothing about the CPU,
   segment:offset, or the VM),
3. writes the result back to original memory/registers,
4. returns to the original control flow with **exact** return mechanics:

```text
near routine:    cpu.s.ip = cpu.pop()
far routine:     cpu.s.ip = cpu.pop(); cpu.s.cs = cpu.pop()
internal block:  cpu.s.ip = <exact continuation IP>
```

Do not assume a routine returns; some are loop bodies, jump targets, or dispatch
stubs. Never add a hook because it looks right — every hook needs oracle
evidence (a VM trace of what the original actually did).

## Registering hooks

```python
from dos_re.hooks import registry

@registry.replace(0x1010, 0x1234, "sqz_decode_1234")
def sqz_decode_1234(cpu):
    ...
```

`dos_re.runtime.create_runtime()` installs everything registered.  Duplicate
registrations at one address fail fast.  `DOS_RE_DISABLE_HOOKS=CS:IP,CS:IP`
disables individual hooks for A/B checks without code changes.

When a lifted parent composes a child routine that is itself hooked, never call
the child's Python function directly — route through
`call_installed_hook_like_near_call` / `jump_installed_hook_boundary` so the
child stays a verifier-visible boundary instead of a shared black box.
`tools/audit_hook_oracle.py` statically enforces this.

## The hook oracle (`dos_re/verification.py`)

The differential verifier wraps every hooked address. On each call it clones
the runtime, executes the **original ASM** on the clone up to the hook's
continuation, executes **your hook** on the live runtime, and diffs registers +
flags + (by default) full memory. Two modes:

- **metadata mode** — the adapter declares each hook's valid continuation
  (`GenericHookStop("near_ret")`, far-ret, iret, fixed-ip, computed dispatch, …).
  Fast; the standing verification for a maturing adapter.
- **strict / auto-continuation mode** (`HookVerifierConfig.strict()`) — runs the
  hook first, takes its final address as the only acceptable target, then runs
  the original ASM to that address and diffs. No metadata to maintain; slower;
  ideal for focused investigation.

On a divergence, set `OK_TRACE_HOOK="CS:IP"` and reproduce: the verifier prints
the exact ASM-oracle instruction trace — what the original did that your hook
did not. Fix the hook to match what the original *did*, not what you think it
should do. The classic bug classes (you will hit all of them): freed-stack
scratch words, flag shape (INC preserves CF — use `dos_re.asm` helpers),
early-out branch selection.

**Full-memory + full-state diffs by default.** Narrowing the diff hides bugs.
Narrow only as a deliberate, temporary performance lever.

## The frame oracle (`dos_re/frame_verify.py`)

Per-hook equivalence gets weaker as hooks collapse into larger native chains,
so the second engine diffs **whole frames**: it steps a reference runtime (pure
ASM) and a candidate runtime (hooked/native) to adapter-defined frame
boundaries, samples framebuffer + visible VRAM (+ whatever state the adapter
adds), and dumps PNG/report artifacts on divergence.

The adapter supplies: boundary addresses (present/timer/retrace), a
`sample_builder`, `reference_env_hooks` (the hardware waits the *oracle* side
must keep so the original ASM doesn't spin forever), optional `pump_inputs`,
and the shared input-wait detector (see
[`demos_and_snapshots.md`](demos_and_snapshots.md) — mandatory reading before
trusting any demo).

Widen the frame sample until it covers **all observable state** — every object
field, RNG state, score/lives, timers, and the framebuffer. *If it is not in
the snapshot, divergence can hide there.*

## Hook roles and lifetimes (`dos_re/hook_taxonomy.py`)

Classify each hook by **role**, not address:

| Role | Meaning | Direction |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **checkpoint** | a real logical resume boundary (frame/object-update/render/input) | keep, make explicit |
| **env_wait** | hardware/environment wait (PIT/IRQ0, CRTC retrace, INT 09h) the interpreter can't satisfy natively | keep hooked, even on the oracle reference |
| **debug_probe** | exists only to observe/verify | keep out of the hot path |
| **glue** | accidental ASM-boundary plumbing (tails, helpers, per-row scan steps) | collapse into native chains between checkpoints |

A registered hook address is scaffolding, not architecture. Collapsing glue
chains into one native flow is desirable — but only with evidence from the real
original call graph, and with correctness protected by the frame/state verifier
rather than by preserving historical hook boundaries.

## One recovered leaf, many adapters

The recovered function is the **single implementation**; everything else is a
thin adapter over it — never a second copy:

1. the **live replacement** (the hybrid runtime skips the ASM body),
2. the **verify checkpoint** (diff vs the oracle at the boundary),
3. the **native runtime consumer** (the VM-less game composes the same leaf),
4. the enhanced backend — but only in lifecycle Stage 6, after the faithful
   game is complete (never during recovery; pitfall #24).

Ground the live hook + verifier *first*; the native side absorbs the grounded
leaf *last*. Duplicating logic between a hook and the native backend is how a
port silently forks from its own proof.

Beyond the confidence ladder on each function
([`methodology.md`](methodology.md)), track which **adapter state** each piece
is in — every rendering/audio piece is exactly one of:

1. **recovered + live-grounded** — leaf + live replacement hook + verifier;
2. **recovered, verify-only** — leaf + checkpoint diff, but the ASM still runs it;
3. **native-consumer-only** — composed by the native side but *not* grounded by
   a live hook (a transitional state to fix — not an endpoint, not "done");
4. **known gap** — not recovered; fails loud everywhere (never a VM fallback);
5. **blocked — history-dependent buffer state** — the original keeps stateful
   buffers (scroll-page rings, self-copies); needs the real stateful model, not
   a from-scratch rebuild;
6. **not worth hooking** — a pure controller/setup wrapper with no hot or
   reusable behaviour.

Record the recovered set itself with `@oracle_link` metadata and a generated
manifest (`dos_re.islands` + `tools/gen_island_manifest.py`) so "what is
recovered" is answered by the code, not by a hand-edited list.

## The hook lifecycle

```text
observe -> classify -> choose boundary -> build ASM oracle -> implement hook -> verify -> document
```

See [`methodology.md`](methodology.md) for each step in detail and
[`ai_porting_charter.md`](ai_porting_charter.md) §4 for the per-slice lifting
loop this fits into.
