# dos_re documentation

Start here — or, if you are the agent about to port a game, start at
[`../START_HERE.md`](../START_HERE.md) (the operational boot sequence).
Reading order for a newcomer: the repo [README](../README.md) →
`lifecycle.md` → `architecture.md` → `ai_porting_charter.md` → `pitfalls.md` →
`porting_new_game.md`.

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [`pitfalls.md`](pitfalls.md) | **The 24 real mistakes** the source ports made — naming, hook bloat, verification narrowing, state-capture timing, determinism traps, SMC, layering, AI hallucination, premature presentation work — each with the consequence and the rule that fixed it. |
| [`cookbook.md`](cookbook.md) | **Problem-indexed techniques** that could not be promoted as code but exist as worked examples in the source repos: timing fast-forward, shadow caches, boot-data extraction, staticizing patched code, layered audio recovery, tick-demo proofs, overnight loops, deployment. Consult it the moment your game hits a wall. |
| [`lifecycle.md`](lifecycle.md) | **The story in order**: EXE-in-VM → hot-path islands → gameplay recovery → islands merge into subsystems → complete faithful VM-less game → VM retires into the oracle seat → enhanced presentation layer last. Defines the shared vocabulary (oracle, island, golden, hybrid, native). |
| [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | The package boundary, the framework module map, execution modes, adapter layering, dependencies. |
| [`ai_porting_charter.md`](ai_porting_charter.md) | **The method, complete.** VM-as-oracle, the two invariants, the lifting loop, the proof spine, the determinism trap, the phased roadmap, the rules of engagement. Written for an AI agent (or human) given this framework and a DOS game. |
| [`methodology.md`](methodology.md) | The naming/altitude discipline: evidence ladder, status ladder (GUESS → CANONICAL), crystallization pyramid, hook lifecycle, fail-fast over guessed fallback. |
| [`hooks_and_verification.md`](hooks_and_verification.md) | Hook registration and return mechanics, the differential hook oracle (metadata + strict modes), the frame oracle, hook taxonomy. |
| [`demos_and_snapshots.md`](demos_and_snapshots.md) | Snapshots, repro artifacts, deterministic input demos (snapshot-anchored + cold-start), and the boundary-clock invariant that keeps demo proofs valid. |
| [`state_mirrors.md`](state_mirrors.md) | The state-view seam: human-named views over the DOS memory image with swappable backends, without weakening byte-exact verification. |
| [`porting_new_game.md`](porting_new_game.md) | The concrete bring-up checklist for a new game, step 0 → the lifting loop, plus the endgame steps and the code-heavy vs data-driven game styles. |
| [`hardware_support.md`](hardware_support.md) | Honest, status-legend-based matrix of the video/audio/timing/DOS models, the unmodeled-I/O policy, and the rule for extending them. |
| [`enhancements.md`](enhancements.md) | The enhanced layer as the ENDGAME (sequencing rule + the audio exception), the faithful/enhanced boundary, the parity gate, and the widescreen / pixel-aspect lessons. |
| [`glossary.md`](glossary.md) | Every project term (oracle, island, coastline, golden, heartbeat, …) in one table. |
| [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) | What's next, what waits for the next port, long-term shape, and decided non-goals. |

  (pre2_port vs overkill_port), what was deliberately excluded, and what still
  needs cleanup.

  — runnable 5-minute demo of the hook/verify/snapshot loop on a synthetic EXE.
- [`../examples/tiny_frame_game/`](../examples/tiny_frame_game/README.md) —
  the whole lifecycle in ten minutes: a synthetic frame-loop game through
  oracle boot, cold-start demos, snapshots, both verification oracles, and a
  state mirror.
